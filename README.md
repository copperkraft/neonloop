# Neoonloop

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is more advanced version of a [game](https://geliogabalus.itch.io/neonloop),
written by me and [geliogabalus](https://github.com/Geliogabalus) for GMTK Game Jam 2021.

## Demo

Playable game is available at [github pages](http://copperkraft.github.io/neonloop)

### How to play?
Move ball to the cyan goal using traction force (hold left mouse button)
Please, note, that ball speed is constant, and it is easier to alternate direction of
the ball from side and not trying to stop the ball from behind.  
Also, traction doesn't work if ball already moving toward the cursor. 

If ball touches walls the level restarts.

You can also try to collect coins, but it is completely optional and might be impossible on some levels.
